## Overview

Unity supports many different kinds of shaders, and this repository was created to show off 10 examples of such shaders: inverted hull outlines, dissolve, dithered transparency, silhouette, scene intersections, dot matrix, stat increases, portal vortex, CRT TV, and vertex waves. Each shader is relatively short and designed to be explainable in about a minute each.

## Software

This project uses Unity 2020.3.21f1 (LTS) and URP 10.6.0, but it should work with other versions.
